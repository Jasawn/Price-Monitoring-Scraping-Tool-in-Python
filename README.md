Project 13: Price Monitor

Problem Statement: 
Almost every e-commerce site has a feature that allows customers to receive alerts on the price 
of a particular product. The alert can be customized so that it is triggered periodically, or when 
the advertised price drops below the threshold and can be restricted to vendors within a 
geographical region. The task here is to build a similar price monitor in Python.

Suggested starting point:
You can start with this tutorial for a slightly different task. It has useful code that you could 
borrow (and properly acknowledge if you do!) https://www.blog.datahut.co/post/how-to-developa-price-comparison-tool-in-python
You can also restrict yourself to a single e-commerce site.

Detailed tasks to perform (note that these tasks can be done in parallel so the tasks can be split 
among members in the group):
1. You will need to be able to get data from an e-commerce site
2. A user-interface is needed to gather the requirements about the query
3. A suitable presentation strategy should be developed to provide the alert in the most 
helpful way (to facilitate the userâ€™s purchase, for example)
4. If the e-commerce site already has a similar alert feature, you can do a comparison with 
your own tool.
